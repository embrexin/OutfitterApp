# OutfitterApp
This is a simple app that suggests clothing outfits based on user input

Create a mobile app frontend using the given files for an Outfitter app. You only need to create the home screen for now. The home screen should display the app name (Outfitter) at the very top and the current weather below the app name. The current weather should be displayed as a horizontally centered row with the temperature in degrees to the left, an icon depicting the current weather (such as a sun) in the middle, and the weather conditions ("Sunny") to the right. You do not need to call any external APIs or do any backend work. For the weather, simply display it as "55 deg F" with a sun icon and "Sunny" to the right.

Below the weather is a button labeled with "See today's suggestions". Below that button is a div labeled "Upcoming events" the div should be shaped like a rectangle with rounded corners and outlined in pink. Inside the div is a list of upcoming events. There should only be one right now, which is "11/14 Friday dinner at 6pm". Next to this event should be an edit icon. At the bottom right corner of this div there should be a button labeled "Add event"

Below the upcoming events div should be a header that says "Recently worn". Below this header should be a grid of recently worn clothing items with 3 items per row. Right now there should be only one row of recently worn items. For now, just replace each item with a rectangular div with rounded corners.

At the very bottom of the home screen is a navigation menu with 3 icons. The home icon is to the left, the closet icon is in the middle, and the settings icon is at the right. Each icon is labeled with its corresponding screen name ("home", "closet", "settings"). 

The background of the app should be a white to blue gradient. Use #47A0DF for blue and #FF8E8E for pink. The "See today's suggestions" button should be green. Use #71B87E for green
